# Supermarket - A PASCAL console simulator of a shopping cart
Very small supermarket cart simulator made in Pascal language with a "database" of products. Added a small program with username and password to access to a system that can add or modify the products available for the user to "buy" in the simulator. Also there is another program with a database to add users to control the administrator program.
